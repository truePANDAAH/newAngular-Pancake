# Angular-Pancake

We are going to replicate Pancake Swap .  
People who are working on this Repo are just studends that want to improve their skills .
We will work with some languages , libraries and frameworks , that u can find on bottom page .
This repo will be updated every time we have new things to show , we hope weekly .

We're going to work in Agile , starting from a design system and next giving to each of us a piece to replicate.
